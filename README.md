# LocalRES Project Repository

## About LocalRES
LocalRES (Local Renewable Energy Solutions) is an EU-funded project under the Horizon 2020 Programme (Grant Agreement no. 957819), focused on empowering Renewable Energy Communities (RECs) to lead the decarbonisation of local energy systems. The project develops innovative digital tools designed to facilitate the active participation of citizens and local stakeholders in the energy transition, thereby enhancing the efficiency and sustainability of energy communities.

#### User interface mockups

We are currently working on developing the user interface for the Planning Tool. Meanwhile, you can take a sneak peek at the [mockups of the mobile version](https://www.figma.com/proto/qDokG0VbDz0m2YZqLuPqOS/_Planning-Tool-%2F-LocalRES?type=design&node-id=26-100146&t=XxSXEmLbPEQNaw1I-1&scaling=min-zoom&page-id=26%3A1357&starting-point-node-id=26%3A100146&mode=design). Enjoy!

*Note: due to the complexity of the mockups, you may experience rendering disruptions. Also, bear in mind that these mockups are not fully functional, so the behaviour of components is limited.*

## Repository Content
This repository hosts the source code related to three deliverables of the LocalRES project:

- **D2.3**: LocalRES database
- **D2.4**: RES-based scenario generator module
- **D2.6**: Assessment module for decision-making

Each directory contains the respective codebases and documentation for the components developed as part of these deliverables, facilitating transparency and collaborative development.

### LocalRES Database
A crucial component of this repository is the database, a comprehensive database that supports the Planning Tool by providing essential data for the various modules of the tool. The development of it is ongoing, and updates are provided with each version release. The repository also includes documentation on the preliminary database structure, data sources, and methodologies as described in deliverable D2.3.
